1. What are the supported data types in Python?
bool	immutable
bytearray	mutable
bytes	immutable
complex	immutable
dict	mutable
types.EllipsisType	immutable
float	immutable
frozenset	immutable
int	immutable
list	mutable
types.NoneType	immutable
types.NotImplementedType	immutable
range	immutable
set	mutable
str	immutable
tuple	immutable


2. What is the difference between tuples and lists in Python?
Lists are mutable while tuples are immutable.
What does this mean? We can change/modify the values of a list but we cannot change/modify the values of a tuple


3. What are Python decorators?
A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.


4. What are generators in Python?
Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. 
A generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).


5. What are shallow and deep copy operations?
A shallow copy constructs a new composite object and then (as far as possible) inserts references into it to objects found in the original.
A deep copy constructs a new composite object and then recursively inserts copies of the objects found in the original into it.


6. Explain Dependency Injection?
It's a technique that allows developing programs with a high level of cohesion and a low level of coupling. 
Perfect for creating robust, scalable and flexible programs.

Cohesion is a measure that allows knowing how much relationship there is in a block of code with itself.
Coupling is the way in which components of our code are related to each other.


7. Explain how you can make a Python Script executable on Unix?
a) Put this in the first line of the script
#!/usr/bin/env python 

b) Make the file executable with
chmod +x myfile.py

c) Execute with
./myfile.py
